# Source files

These are the source codes to accompany the video course Learning Javascript Promises. 
To each video corresponds two zip files, one to be used at the beginning of the video, and one for comparison of what the code should look like at the end of the video.

Note that you can find the same source by following the corresponding tags on the `master` branch of https://bitbucket.org/mchauvinc/learning-javascript-promises/overview

## Per video

The file to use for each video follows the pattern "s[section_number]v[video_number].zip", meaning that the code for video 3 in section 2 is `s2v3.zip`

To find the code bundle to compare at the end of the video, simply prepend "after_" to the zip name: for the above example, at the end of video 3 section 2, refer to `after_s2v3.zip`

## Per section

There are also section codes, e.g. `s2initial.zip` and `s2final.zip` which contain the code in its state at the beginning of each section (section 2 here) and at the end of each section.
